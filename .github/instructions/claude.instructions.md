Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# Coding Standards and Preferences for Vector2Godot
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Include comments and documentation for complex logic.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).

# Domain Knowledge
- The project is a desktop application built with Electron and Vite.
- It uses TypeScript for the main application logic.
- The application is designed to convert vector graphics to Godot-compatible formats.

# Preferences
- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+).
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Use Promises for handling asynchronous tasks.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.
- Use arrow functions for concise function expressions.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays where appropriate.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations.
- Use `import` and `export` for module management.
- Use `async` functions for asynchronous operations.
- Use `try/catch` for error handling in asynchronous code.
- Use `console.log` for debugging, but remove or replace with proper logging before production.
- Use `eslint` and `prettier` for code formatting and linting.
- Use `npm` for package management.
- Use `git` for version control.
- Use `electron-builder` for building the application.
