Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# Coding Standards and Preferences for Vector2Godot
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Include comments and documentation for complex logic.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.

- After each completed chat, increment the version number by 0.0.1
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- For example, if the current version is 1.0.0, the next version should be 1.0.1.
- If the version is 1.0.1, the next version should be 1.0.2.
- If the version is 1.0.2, the next version should be 1.0.3. etc.

# Domain Knowledge
- The project is a desktop application built with Electron and Vite.
- It uses TypeScript for the main application logic.
- The application is designed to convert vector graphics to Godot-compatible formats.

# Preferences
- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+).
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Use Promises for handling asynchronous tasks.
- Use template literals for string interpolation.
- Use arrow functions for concise function expressions.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays where appropriate.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations.
- Use `import` and `export` for module management.
- Use `async` functions for asynchronous operations.
- Use `try/catch` for error handling in asynchronous code.
- Use `console.log` for debugging, but remove or replace with proper logging before production.
- Use `eslint` and `prettier` for code formatting and linting.
- Use `npm` for package management.
- Use `git` for version control.
- Use `electron-builder` for building the application.

# Versioning
- The version number should be updated after each chat.
- The version number should follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- The version number should be incremented by 0.0.1 after each chat.
- The version number should be included in the commit message.
- The version number should be included in the `package.json` file.
- The version number should be included in the `build-all.sh` script.
- The version number should be included in the `README.md` file.
- The version number should be included in the `index.html` file.
- The version number should be included in the `style.css` file.
- The version number should be included in the `electron-main.cjs` file.
- The version number should be included in the `electron-preload.cjs` file.
- The version number should be included in the `vite.config.ts` file.
- The version number should be included in the `tsconfig.json` file.
- The version number should be included in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- The version number should be included in the `LICENSE` file.
