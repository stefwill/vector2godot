# Vector2Godot Modular Architecture Summary

## Overview

The Vector2Godot application has been successfully refactored from a monolithic architecture (single 3000+ line file) into a clean, modular architecture with 8 focused modules. This change improves maintainability, testability, and scalability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Architecture Benefits

### 🎯 **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each module has a clear, focused responsibility:
- **SplashScreen**: Loading screen management
- **SettingsManager**: Application settings and persistence
- **ShapeManager**: Shape operations and geometry
- **CanvasRenderer**: Drawing and visual rendering
- **EventHandler**: User input and interactions
- **ToolManager**: Drawing tools and properties
- **CodeGenerator**: Godot code generation and exports
- **UIManager**: User interface and modals

### 🔧 **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Changes in one module don't affect others
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better code organization

### 🧪 **Enhanced Testability**
- Each module can be tested independently
- Easier to mock dependencies
- Better unit test coverage
- Isolated testing environments

### 👥 **Better Team Development**
- Multiple developers can work on different modules
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear module boundaries
- Easier code reviews

### 🚀 **Performance Improvements**
- Increased Node.js memory limit to 4GB
- Better memory management
- Optimized module loading
- Improved error handling
